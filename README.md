# GBCTileViewer

Hex viewer written in Java using the JavaFX GUI library. Currently lets you view the hex contents of a ROM file and the graphics tiles as two seperate scrolling panels.

Future Plans:
  To add tile graphics editing capabilities and have the two panels communicate and sync their location in the file on click.
